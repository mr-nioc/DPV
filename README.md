## A Partial Solution Manual for Algorithms - S. Dasgupta, C. H. Papadimitriou, and U. V. Vazirani

The basic structure follows @mbhushan's DPV repo.

I have deleted all the python scripts because many of them are not relavent for the solution. Most of the solutions are analytical not computational. My updates are on solutions' markdown files.

The final solutions may contain errors. Use with caution. Also do raise an issue, if you find any errors.
