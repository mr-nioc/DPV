## An Incomplete Solution Manual for Algorithms - S. Dasgupta, C. H. Papadimitriou, and U. V. Vazirani

The basic structure follows @mbhushan's DPV repo.

I have deleted all the python scripts because many of them are not relavent for the solution. Most of the solutions are analytical not computational. My updates are on solutions' markdown files.

So far, this manual is incomplete. I'll try my best to finish it.

The final solutions may contain errors. Use with caution. Also do raise an issue, if you find any errors.

### Hard ones

For exercises tallied in this section, I either didn't/still don't understand the exercise, couldn't solve it or both. I'll come back to them later. Sometimes, to solve a problem, all you ever need is to clear your mind, walk away for a while, and come back to finish it later.

### FAQs

1. Why do you upload your solutions to a public repository?
    
    I upload my solutions to document my own learning process. I find that it is easier for me spot errors and mistakes when I write the solution down. I made it public because I want other learners to correct my mistakes that I overlooked.

1.  Would I get a perfect score in my assignment if I copy-and-pasted the solutions here?
   
    I don't think so. I purposely omitted the obvious steps in many of my solutions. But the basic ideas are there. In order to get a perfect score, I would fill in those holes and give as much details as required by your instructor.

1. Do you think the material provided here encourages cheating?

    No. It is good to have a freely accessible solution manual. To cheat or not to cheat, that's a choice you make. I stay neutral to your freedom to choose, but I encourage learning. I am glad if the material provided here helps your learning.

1. Can I fork it?

    Fork away! Just remember to add a link back to this repository.
