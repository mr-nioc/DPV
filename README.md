## An Incomplete Solution Manual for Algorithms - S. Dasgupta, C. H. Papadimitriou, and U. V. Vazirani

The basic structure follows @mbhushan's DPV repo.

I have deleted all the python scripts because many of them are not relavent for the solution. Most of the solutions are analytical not computational. My updates are on solutions' markdown files.

So far, this manual is incomplete. I'll try my best to finish it.

The final solutions may contain errors. Use with caution. Also do raise an issue, if you find any errors.

### Missing ones

For exercises tallied in this section, I either didn't/still don't understand the exercise, couldn't solve it or both. I'll come back to them later. Sometimes, to solve a problem, all you ever need is to clear your mind, walk away for a while, and come back to finish it later.
