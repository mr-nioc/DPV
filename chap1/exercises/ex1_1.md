1.1. Show that in any base b â‰¥ 2, the sum of any three single-digit numbers is at most two digits long.

solution:

1. let x, y, z be the single digit numbers in base b.

1. Now x, y and z can be at most (b-1). eg. in base 10 max single digit is 9.

1. lets call the 3 single digit sum as S, now S = x + y + z

1. $S = x + y + z = (b-1) + (b-1) + (b-1) = 3b - 3$

1. The value of the largest two digit number is $V = b^3-1$

2. The difference between the two is $V-S = b^3-1-3b+3=(b-1)^2(b+2)>0$ for $b\ge 2$. $\square$
