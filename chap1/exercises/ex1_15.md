1.15. Determine necessary and sufficient conditions on x and c so that the following holds: for any a, b,
if ax ≡ bx mod c, then a ≡ b mod c.

solution:
Statement : For any a, b, if $ax \equiv bx$ mod c, then $a \equiv b$ mod c.

The necessary and sufficient condition is for x and c to be coprime or relatively prime, such that $x^{-1}$ mod c exists. One can multiply both sides with the multiplicative inverse of x to obtain the desired result. Other sufficient but not necessary conditions may require c prime and $0 < x < c$.
