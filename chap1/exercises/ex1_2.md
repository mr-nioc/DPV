1.2. Show that any binary integer is at most four times as long as the corresponding decimal integer.
For very large numbers, what is the ratio of these two lengths, approximately?

solution:
1. For an integer of value V, its binary representation is of length $l2 = \lceil \log_2(V+1)\rceil$, and its decimal representation is of length $l10 = \lceil \log_{10}(V + 1)\rceil$
2. $l2 = \lceil \log_2 10 \cdot \log_{10}(V + 1)\rceil \le \lceil \log_2{10}\rceil \cdot \lceil \log_{10}(V+1) \rceil = 4\times l10$
3. $\lim_{n \to \infty} l2/l10 = \lim_{n \to \infty} \log_2(V+1)/\log_{10}(V+1) = \log_{2}10 \approx 3.32$. $\square$

Note: a useful identity used above is the changing of log base $\log_ab=\log_a c\cdot \log_c b$.
