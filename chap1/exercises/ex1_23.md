Show that if a has a multiplicative inverse modulo N , then this inverse is unique (modulo N ).

Solution:

Prove by contradiction.

Suppose m and n are multiplicative inverses of a mod N, $0\le n<N$, $0\le m<N$and $m\ne n$. Then,

$ma \equiv 1 \equiv na \mod N$,

and multiplying both size with $a^{-1}$ (either m, n or any other inverse), one obtains

$m \equiv n \mod N$.

Then,

$m = n + kN$,

for some integer k. Since both m and n are between 0 and N, k must be 0 and therefore, $m=n$. Contradiction. $\square$
