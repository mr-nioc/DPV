1.26. What is the least significant decimal digit of 17^(17^17) ? 
(Hint: For distinct primes p, q, and any a ≠ 0 (mod pq), 
we proved the formula a^((p−1)(q−1)) ≡ 1 (mod pq) in Section 1.4.2.)

Ans:

We need to calculate $17^{17^{17}} \mod 10$. It can be simplified using the Euler's theorem with 2 primes 2 and 5, which are factors of 10. 

Use the identity $a^4\equiv 1 \mod 10$ for $a=17$ to simplify the result:

$17^{17^{17}} = (17^{17})^{17} = (17^{17})^{16}17^{17}\equiv 17^{17} \equiv 17^{4\times 4}17\equiv 17 \equiv 7 \mod 10$. $\square$

Note: the hint is actually incorrect for any $a\ne 0 \mod pq$, althought in this case, it is since 17 and 10 are coprime. The correct statement should be $a\cdot a^{(p-1)*(q-1)}\equiv a \mod pq$. You may not further simplify the equation further by eliminating a on both side bacause its inverse may not exist modulus pq. It doesn't make any diffference in this excercise, but try $2^4 \mod 10$ which equals 6 not 1 as a counter example.
