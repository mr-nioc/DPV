Ans:

For a family of hash functions to be universal, exactly $|H|/n$ of all hash functions in H map two distinct items into the same bucket, and n is the number of buckets (condition 1).

Clearly (a) is universal. See the proof on page 43, with $a_3=a_4=0$. The size of the family is $m^2$ which is $2\log m$ bits.

In that proof, the probability of choosing the correct $a_2\equiv a_1(x_1-y_1)(x_2-y_2)^{-1} \mod m$ is $1/m$. 

(b) is not universal because for some items, the multiplicative inverse may not exist and thus no collision. The size of the family is the same as before $2\log m=2k$ bits.

(c) is universal. The number of hash functions is the number of ways to put m unique balls into m-1 buckets, which is $(m-1)^m$, and $m\log (m-1)$ bit long. The number of functions that map two distinct items x and y into the same bucket i, for $i\in [m-1]$, is the same as the number of ways to put the rest of the balls (m-2 of them) into m-1 bins, which is $(m-1)^{m-2}$, and for all the choices of i, the number of colliding hashing functions on x and y is $(m-1)^{m-1}$. And condition 1 is satisfied.
