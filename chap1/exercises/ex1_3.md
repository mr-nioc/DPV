1.3. A d-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has at most d children. Show that any d-ary tree with n nodes must have a depth of Î©(log n/ log d). Can you give a precise formula for the minimum depth it could possibly have?

solution:

1. Consider a tree of depth h where each node have exactly d children. The number of nodes of this tree is the maximum number of node for a tree of depth h.
2. The total number of nodes is $n = \sum_{i=1}^{h}{d^{i-1}}=\frac{d^h-1}{d-1}$
3. Solving for h, one can obtain $h=\lceil \frac{\log(dn-n+1)}{\log d}\rceil\ge \frac{\log(d-1)+\log n}{\log d}\ge \frac{\log n}{\log d}$. $\square$
