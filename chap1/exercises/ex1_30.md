1.30 The grade-school algorithm ...

Ans:

a. Arrange adders like a pyramid. At the base, there are n/2 adders to add each pair of numbers, and their result are added pairwise at the 2nd level. The pyramid is $\log n$ high, and each level is $\log m$ deep. Thus, the total depth is $\log n \log m$.

b. Add three binary numbers bit wise, and for each bit, store the result of the lower bit to s and the carry bit to r. This step can be performed bit-wise, and $x+y+z = 2r+s$. A complete add is needed for the final result.

c. Multiply two n-bit numbers using the grade-school algorithm is equivalent to adding n $2n$-bit numbers. Use the pyramid scheme, but in groups of 3 numbers. Each level can execute in one step; there are $\lceil (\log n - 1)/\log 3/2 \rceil$ levels, and the depth of this part is $O(\log n)$; and the final step need to fully add two $2n$-bit numbers, and with a look-ahead circuit, the final step is of depth $O(\log n)$. Thus, the whole depth of the circuit is $O(\log n)$. $\square$
