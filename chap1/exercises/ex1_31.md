1.31 Consider the problem of ...

Ans:

a. Due to ex1.4, $\log N!=\Theta(N\log N)$. Since $n= \lceil\log N+1\rceil$, the length of $N!$ is $\lceil \log N! +1\rceil =\Theta(\log N!) = \Theta(N\log N) = \Theta(n2^n)$.

b. A naive algorithm could be:
```
FACT(N):
    IF N<=1:
        RETURN 1
    ELSE:
        RETURN N*FACT(N-1)
```
Suppose the multiplication of m and n bit numbers is $mn$, its run time is approximately $\sum_{i=0}^n{2^ii^2}$. $\square$
