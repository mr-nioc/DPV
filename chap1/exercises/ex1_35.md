1.35 Wilson's theorem says ...

Ans:

a. For p prime, only 1 and p-1 are their own inverse. A little proof follows:

Since $xx\equiv 1 \mod p$, we have $kp = x^2-1=(x+1)(x-1)$ for some integer k. Since p is prime, either p divides $x+1$ or $x-1$. In the former case, 

$x+1=mp$,

and then

$x\equiv -1 \mod p$. Similarly, in the latter case,

$x\equiv 1 \mod p$. These are the only solutions for p prime.

b. For $p=2$, $1!=1\equiv-1 \mod 2$. For $p>2$, there are $p-3$ numbers in 2 to $p-2$. Since all of these numbers have unique inverses, and they can be paired up in the product, and therefore the only term left is $p-1$, which is $-1 \mod p$.

c. [Proof by contradition] Suppose $(N-1)!\equiv -1 \mod N$. If N is not prime, then there exists an integer $1<d<N$ that divides N. Then, $(N-1)!$ and N are not coprime, and $(N-1)!$ does not have an inverse modulo N. On the other hand, we have $N-1$ as  its inverse modulo N, since $(N-1)!(N-1)\equiv (-1)(-1)\equiv 1 \mod N$. Contradiction. $\square$

d. Because a naive algorithm to calculate factorial also has an exponential time complexity, we can not immediately base a primality test on this rule.
