1.36 Square roots ...

Ans:

a. Since $p=3 + 4k$ for some integer k, then 

$p+1=4(k+1)$,

and thus, $(p+1)/4$ is an integer.

b. Suppose a has a square root modulo p. To show $a^{(p+1)/4}$ is a square root, we need to prove $a^{(p+1)/2}\equiv a \mod p$. Notice that

$a^{(p+1)/2} = aa^{(p-1)/2} \mod p$,

all we need to prove is 

$a^{(p-1)/2}\equiv 1 \mod p$.

Since $p\equiv 3 \mod 4$, all the exponents are integers. Let x be a's square root modulo p, and then we have

$a^{(p-1)/2}=x^{p-1}\equiv 1 \mod p$,

due to Fermat's little theorem. $\square$

Note: In your proof, you want to trace our steps backwards. Most proofs are structured that way, albeit non-intuitive for the reader. The proof provided here should go on your scatch paper, not your final write-up.
