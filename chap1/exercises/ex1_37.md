1.37 The Chinese remainder theorem ...

Ans:

a. A tall table.

b. First, we prove the uniqueness of i.

[Proof by contradiction] Suppose we have two distinct integers i and i' between 0 and pq, such that 

$i\equiv j \equiv i' \mod p$

and

$i\equiv k\equiv i' \mod q$.

Then, we must have $r=r'+mpq$ for some integer $m\ne 0$, since p and q are primes and r and r' are distinct. Then r and r' must be at least pq apart. Contradiction.

Second, note that there are $p\times q$ unique pairs of $(j,k)$, and also $p\times q$ number of r, then there must be one r for each pair.

c. We go from i to j and k.

$i = \{...\} + spq$

for some integer s.

$i \mod p \equiv jq(q^{-1} \mod p) \mod p \equiv j \mod p$,

and similarly

$i \mod q \equiv k \mod q$.

d. Sure. But I won't type the CRT in its full glory. It is quite a handful. You can google it to get its general form. The proof of its general form follows in a similar way as what we have done here. $\square$
