1.38 To see if a number ...

Ans:

a. We need an integer r such that $10^r\equiv 1 \mod p$. Euler's theorem provide such an option, $p-1$, but it may not be the smallest. A linear search shows that for $p=13$, the smallest r is 6 and it is 16 for $p=17$.

b. [Proof by contradiction] Suppose r is not a divisor of $p-1$, and r is the smallest number that satisfies the condition $10^r\equiv 1 \mod p$ (condition 1).

Due to Euler's theorem, $10^{p-1}\equiv 1 \mod p$. If there exists no number smaller than $p-1$ that satisfies condition 1, then $p-1$ is such a choice, and it is a divisor of $p-1$. Contradiction.

Next, we consider the other case where there exists a number $r<p-1$ satisfying condition 1. In this case, we can find another number smaller than r that also satisfies the condition, and thus leading into a contradiction. That choice would be $r'=p-1 \mod r$. Clearly, $r'$ is smaller than r. It also satisfies condition 1 because there exists an integer k, such that 

$r'=p-1+rk$, 

and then

$10^{r'}=10^{p-1+rk}=(10^{p-1})(10^r)^k\equiv (1)(1)^k \equiv 1 \mod p$.

Contradiction. $\square$
