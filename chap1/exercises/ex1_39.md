1.39 Give a polynomial-time ...

Ans:

Let FAST_EXP(a, b, p) be the recursive modulo exponentiation procedure detailed in the textbook. This procedure have a $O(n^3)$ time complexity, where n is the number of bits of p.

To calculate $a^{b^c}\mod p$, we recursively call FAST_EXP

FAST_EXP(FAST_EXP(a, b, p), c, p).

The run-time is thus also $O(n^3)$. $\square$
