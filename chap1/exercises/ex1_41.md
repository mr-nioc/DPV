1.41 Quadradic residuals. ...

Ans:

a. We must show 1) x and -x are two roots, 2) they are distinct, and 3) there is not a third distinct root.

First, since $a$ is a quadratic residual, there exists a non-zero integer $r$ satisfying 

$r^2\equiv a \mod N$ (condition 1).

Then $-r$ also satisfies condition 1, and hence $-r$ is another quadratic root mod N.

[Proof by contradiction] Second, suppose $r\equiv -r \mod N$. Then, 

$2r\equiv 0 \mod N$,

and since N is odd, 2 have an inverse modulo N and we can remove 2 on both sides and have

$r\equiv 0 \mod N$.

Contradiction. Therefore, $r$ and $-r$ are two distinct roots of $a$.

[Proof by contradiction] Third, suppose there is a third root $r'$, and $r'\ne \pm a\mod N$. Then,

$(r'-r)(r'+r)\not\equiv 0 \mod N$,

and then

$(r'-r)(r'+r)\equiv r'^2-r^2\equiv a -a \equiv 0 \mod N$.

Contradiction. $\square$

b. 0 is a quadradic residual which has a single root 0. For all other non-zero quadradic residuals, they each have two distinct roots as proved previously in a). Thus, there are in total $1+(N-1)/2=(N=1)/2$ quadradic residuals modulo N for an odd prime N.

c. Remember the primality test for Carmickael numbers? 

One such example would be for $a=1$ and $N=8$. We have $1^2\equiv 5^2\equiv 7^2\equiv 1 \mod 8$. 

Note: We call $a$ a quadradic residual because 1) it can be expressed as a square (the quadradic part), and 2) it is what is left over after removing multiples of $N$ from that square (the residual part).
