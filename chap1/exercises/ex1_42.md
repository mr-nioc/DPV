Ans:

In this scheme, we can simply calculate the private key $d=e^{-1}\mod p-1$ using the extended Eulid's algorithm, which has a time complexity of $O(n^3)$. The decryption can be carried out by using procedure FAST_EXP (see ex 1.39), which has a time complexity of $O(n^3)$. So overall it is $O(n^3)$ in time.

The correctness of the decryption can be justified using Fermat's little theorem. $\square$
