Ans:

We know d, $e=3$, and N, and we want to find p and q efficiently.

Since $de\equiv 1 \mod (p-1)(q-1)$, there exists an integer k such that

$3d-1=k(p-1)(q-1)$.

Thus,

$k = \frac{3d-1}{(p-1)(q-1)}$,

where $d<(p-1)(q-1)$.

So k can only take 0, 1 or 2.

Try all those options, and then we know $(p-1)(q-1)$. Since we know N, we now know $p+q$. A linear search using a primality test can reveal both p and q. $\square$
