Ans:

Use the CRT. A straight forward plug and chug. At the very end, take the cubic root to recover M. It is too tedius to type all the symbols here. So I am not doing it. 

This is also called the same message attack. For this attack to work, we need $N_i$ to be coprime with each other. In this example, since all the primes are randomly chosen, the chance of a collision is low.
