1.45 RSA and digital signatures ...

Ans:

a. For certification purposes.

b. In the RSA cryptosystem, the use of keys e and d are symmetric. For this exercise, just swap e with d in the implementation and correctness proof of the RSA algorithm for encryption. Again, it is too tedius to repeat those words, so I am not doing it here.

c. Again, too tedius to show. This is the same process as shown in the textbook just with e and d swapped.

d. A few tries show us that $391=17*23$. The corresponding privatre key is 145 using the extended Euclid's algorithm, so she should raise her message to the power of 145, which is the number of this exercise!
