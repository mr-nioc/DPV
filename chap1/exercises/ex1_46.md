1.56 Digital signatures, continued ...

Ans:

a. This is silly. Just ask Bob to sign all the intercepted encrypted messages Alice sent to Bob.

b. Pick a number $1<k<N$. Calculate gcd(k, N). If it is not 1, we have just obtained one of the prime factors by sheer luck, then we can decrypt the message ourselves. If it is 1, we do the following.

Send Bob $M^ek^e \mod N$, and Bob would send you back $M_b = Mk \mod N$. Then we apply the inverse of k to $M_b$ to recover the original message $M_bk^{-1}=Mkk^{-1}\equiv M \mod N$.
