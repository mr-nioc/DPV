1.5. Unlike a decreasing geometric series, the sum of the harmonic series 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, . . . di-
verges; that is,

∞
∑(1/i) = ∞
i=1

It turns out that, for large n, the sum of the first n terms of this series can be well approximated as

n
∑(1/i) ≈ ln n + γ
i=1

where ln is natural logarithm (log base e = 2.718 . . .) and γ is a particular constant 0.57721 . . ..
Show that
n
∑(1/i) = Θ(log n)
i=1
(Hint: To show an upper bound, decrease each denominator to the next power of two. For a lower
bound, increase each denominator to the next power of 2.)

solution:

Upper Bound:

a. 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 ... + 1/n <= 1 + (1/2 + 1/2) + (1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4) + ...

$\sum_{i=1}^n {(1/i)} \le 1 + (2/2) + (4/4) \dots$

There are $\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor$ such parenthesized terms. The final term may not be complete for some n, but we are including all the term up to the next two's power. Therefore, $S = \sum_{i=1}^n{1/i} \le \lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor\le 1+\log_2 n$, and $S\in O(\log n)$.


Lower Bound:

a. 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + ... <= 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + ...

$\sum_{i=1}^n {(1/i)} \le 1 + (1/2) + (2/4) \dots$

The final term may not be complete for some n, and we are discarding all the incomplete terms up to the previous two's power. Again, there are $\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor$ parenthesized terms. Therefore, $S \ge 1 + 1/2\cdot \lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor$, and $S\in \Omega(\log n)$. $\square$
