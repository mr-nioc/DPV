1.9. Starting from the definition of x ≡ y mod N (namely, that N divides x−y), 
justify the substitution rule

x ≡ x' mod N, y ≡ y' mod N    ⇒    x + y ≡ x' + y' mod N,

and also the corresponding rule for multiplication.

solution:

We have $x=x' + k_xN$ and $y=y' + k_yN$ for some integer $k_x$ and $k_y$. Then,

$x+y = x' + y' + k_xN + k_yN = x' + y' + (k_x+k_y)N \equiv x'+y'\mod N$. 

The rule for multiplication can be proved similarly. $\square$
